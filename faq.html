    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <h3>What is a Hackathon?</h3>
    <p>A hackathon is an event where teams come together to solve problems 
        using either software or hardware over a short time period, often 
        only 24 or 48 hours. This problem is usually given by the hackathon 
        organizers and practical solutions are encouraged. </p>

    <p>Teams can be anywhere from 2-4 people.</p>
