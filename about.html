    <h2>About</h2>
<p>HarbourHacks was started by Laura Wright, a grade 12 student at Citadel High School.
    After being a Future Tech Intern at Nokia Canada over the summer she realized
    for many other Canadian high school students hackathons were a regular weekend activity. 
    However, in Halifax there are no in-person hackathons for high school students. 
    In realization of this she created her own. Garnering support from SuperNOVA @ Dalhousie Univeristy 
    for resources. Laura secured funding from the GLOCAL Foundnation in support of resources required.
