    <h2 id="about">Welcome to...</h2>
    <h1>HarbourHacks</h1>
    <h2>About</h2>
<p>HarbourHacks was started by Laura Wright, a grade 12 student at Citadel High School.
    After being a Future Tech Intern at Nokia Canada over the summer she realized
    for many other Canadian high school students hackathons were a regular weekend activity. 
    However, in Halifax there are no in-person hackathons for high school students. 
    In realization of this she created her own. SuperNOVA @ Dalhousie University helped 
    secure the venue. 
    Laura secured funding and resources from the GLOCAL Foundnation in support of resources 
    required.

        organizers and practical solutions are encouraged. </p>
